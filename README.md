# Photo-Gallery-Project
This website was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with interactive hover elements, Flexbox, and the coolors.co color tool. After a few months of quarantine during the Covid-19 pandemic, I built this site to express my love for traveling and to serve as a reminder of the beauty of the world around us.
